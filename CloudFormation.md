# CloudFormation

* Use a simple text file to model and provivision your entire infrastructure
* For example:
    * Security group
    * 2x EC2s
    * S3 Bucket
    * Controlled by an ELB
    * ... CloudFormation will then do all this for you in the right order
* Serves as a single source of truth for the entire environment
* No charge for using the service - only the resources behind it

#### Benefits

* All infrastructure is code
* Can estimate the costs from the template
* Can destroy or create infrastructure on the fly
* Leverage existing templates on the web
* Enables modeling, provisioning and version control of the whole infrastructure
